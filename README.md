<h1 align="center">Responsive Oil & Gas News Website templates</h1>

This is a site theme that I designed for Drilling Data in 2015.  It's a responsive update to their desktop only site. 

The links in the main navbar work - use the Template dropdown to access every template.

There are over 40 templates in the project.  Comprised of mostly HTML/CSS besides some very minor Javascript.  PHP is used only for templating purposes to include re-usable elements (header/footer/etc).  For this client, I would create these coded templates to pass off to the back-end development team.  This would enable rapid site development between myself and the product owner. 

This design uses the awesome Museo Sans Rounded font available here: https://www.myfonts.com/fonts/exljbris/museo-sans-rounded/

This also uses the YAMM 3 mega menu for Bootstrap - a life-saver at the time for the amount of sub links requested.  Learn more about YAMM here: http://geedmo.github.com/yamm3

This is a working Node.js development environment utilizing Grunt , Browsersync, Bootstrap 3, Babel, Less, and css/js minification.

## How to get started?

1. Clone this repo
2. yarn or npm install to install the required dependencies
3. Use 'gulp emulate' to kickoff the dev PHP server - it will automatically open a browser window with the project. Use 'gulp' if you will use your php environment and just want to watch for changes.  
4. Edit html files in /public, and and js or less files in /src and Browser-sync will reload after any changes.
